This is a hybrid mobile app project done with Flutter.

In this app, you can search for movies in any language and get its details such as Genre, Director, Cast, Runtime, Release Date, a summary for the plot of the movie,
as well as ratings from IMDB(Internet Movie Database), Rotten Tomatoes, as well as Metacritic (if they have rated that specific movie). 

The user is provided with a search field to enter the name of the movie to search for, and relevant movie suggestions are provided to the user in real-time. This feature was not done using any other prebuilt packages. I used just a simple ListView.builder widget and updated it whenever the user changes the data in the text field. ;)

For extracting the movie data, a fully open API called the **OMDB API** by Brian Fritz was used (www.omdbapi.com).

This project was done for educational purposes and purely out of love towards Flutter <3
